# Computational Estimation of Fetal DNA Fraction in Low Coverage Whole Genome Sequencing Data

This repository holds a selection of source codes that were developed in a Masterâ€™s thesis 'Computational Estimation of Fetal DNA Fraction in Low Coverage Whole Genome Sequencing Data'. 


This repository does not contain all of the scripts used, for example, SeqFF with the modified input is not included, but other important scripts are included. These are uploaded for illustrating the developing process and to ease the process of reproducibility. They are not intended to illustrate code style.


For further information, please contact Priit Paluoja, the author of the thesis.

# Computational Estimation of Fetal DNA Fraction in Low Coverage Whole Genome Sequencing Data

This repository holds source codes that were developed in a Masterâ€™s thesis 'Computational Estimation of Fetal DNA Fraction in Low Coverage Whole Genome Sequencing Data'. 


This repository does not contain modified version of the SeqFF (modified input). Source codes are uploaded for illustrating the developing process and to ease the process of reproducibility. They are not intended to illustrate code style.


For further information, please contact Priit Paluoja, the author of the thesis.
